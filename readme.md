# Vuejs Structure
In this project you can see a structure create by me for a competition WorldSkills Kazán 2019 in 17. Web technologies.

`The problem was we not permitted to use npm dependencies or Vue CLI in competition.` 

## Folders & files
These are a principal folders and files of the project.
```
 📁 assets - CSS & JS files or external libraries.
 📁 components - reusable components in views. 
 📁 routes - routes of project.
 📁 store - global data.
 📁 views - views of project using components.
 📃 app.js - global configuration of VueJS.
 📃 index.html - here import all files and contain principal element #app.
```

## Libraries
* Here only use `vue-router` for routes management in project and not was permitted use `vuex` for this reason I create a global store data in `store/index.js`.
* The styles, animations, fetch data, get HTML elements and parse data are created by me `assets/*`.
